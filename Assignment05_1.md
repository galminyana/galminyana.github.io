## Assignment #5.1: Polymorphing
---
---
### Introduction
---
One of the shellcodes to be used in this assignment and to obtain a polymorphic version of it is the [# Linux/x86_64 sethostname() & killall 33 bytes shellcode](http://shell-storm.org/shellcode/files/shellcode-605.php) by **zbt**.

The size of the shellcode is 33 bytes. This means that the polymorphic version of it can't be more than 49 bytes (150% of original size).

### GitHub Repo Files

The [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/galminyana/SLAE64/tree/main/Assignment04) for this assignment contains the following files:

- [Encoder.c](https://github.com/galminyana/SLAE64/blob/main/Assignment04/Encoder.c) : This C file is the implementation of the Encoder Scheme. Prints out a encoded shellcode.
- [Decode-Execve-Stack.nasm](https://github.com/galminyana/SLAE64/blob/main/Assignment04/Decode-Execve-Stack.nasm) : This is the NULL free code for the Egg Hunter.
- [Execve-Stack.nasm](https://github.com/galminyana/SLAE64/blob/main/Assignment4/ReverseShell-ExecveStack_V2.nasm) : This is the code for the shellcode to use in the PoC.
- [shellcode.c](https://github.com/galminyana/SLAE64/blob/main/Assignment04/shellcode.c) : The C template Decode-Execve-Stack.nasm Shellcode, ready to compile and execute

## Assignment #1
## Bind_Shell_TCP

### Introduction
Requirements for this assignment are to create a Shell_Bind_TCP shellcode that: 

 1. Listens on a specific port 
 2. Requires a password 
 3. If the password is correct, then Exec Shell is executed 
 4. Also, the NULL bytes (0x00) must be removed from the shellcode 

To build the shellcode, we is required the use of the linux sockets and do the following steps: 

 1. Create a socket 
 2. Bind the socket to a port 
 3. Start listenning for connections 
 4. Accept incoming connections 
 5. Ask, read, and validate the password 
 6. Duplicate `SDTIN`, `STDOUT` and `STDERR` to the socket descriptor 
 7. Execute /bin/sh for the incoming and validated conection 

In case the password is not correct, the shellcode will exit with a Segmentation Fault. The shellcode wonâ€™t care on how the program terminates. This makes sense as shellcode will be smaller in size and really does not matter how it exits. 

For Linux Sockets Programming, the following System calls are required on this assignment: 

```c
int socket(int domain, int type, int protocol); 
int bind(int sockfd, const struct sockaddr *addr, socklen_t addrlen); 
int listen(int sockfd, int backlog); 
int accept(int sockfd, struct sockaddr *addr, socklen_t *addrlen); 
int close(int sockfd); 
```
To duplicate the standard input, output and error, `dup2()` call will be used: 

```c
int dup2(int oldfd, int newfd); 
```
From the manpage:

```markdown
The dup2() system call performs the same task as dup(), but instead of using the lowest-numbered unused file descriptor,  it uses the file descriptor number specified in newfd.  If the file descriptor newfd was previously open, it is silently closed before being reused.  
```

And to execute `/bin/sh`, will use the `execve()` call: 

```c
int execve(const char *filename, char *const argv[], char *const envp[]); 
```
